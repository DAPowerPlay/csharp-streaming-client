This is an example how to use [SocketIoClientDotNet](https://github.com/Quobject/SocketIoClientDotNet) 
to connect to our [DPP DataStreams](https://platform.dapowerplay.com/services/free)

This project contains .NET Framework Console App connecting and subscribing to a stream, registering a listener for e.g. 'trades' to recieve the data.
